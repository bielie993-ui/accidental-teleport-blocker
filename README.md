# Accidental Teleport Blocker
A simple plugin which blocks teleports to prevent accidental teleports while casting other spells in any spellbook. The block can be overruled by pressing a modifier key.

This idea came from the frustration of accidentally teleporting while trying to cast high alchemy or manually casting other spells.

### Features
- Shift right click on any teleport in any spellbook to toggle the teleport block for that specific spell.
- The teleport block can be overruled by holding down a modifier key which can be configured in the settings (CTRL is default).
- Right click casting will still work but can be disabled in the settings.
- To help with alching while scaping you can enable a config option to only block teleports while alching.

### Future ideas
- Add windows for other spells.
