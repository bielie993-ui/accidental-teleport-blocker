# Accidental Teleport Blocker
A simple plugin which blocks teleports to prevent accidental teleports while casting other spells in any spellbook. The block can be overruled by pressing a modifier key.

This idea came from the frustration of accidentally teleporting while trying to cast high alchemy or manually casting other spells.
